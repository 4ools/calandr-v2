  Jump, sweat, and burn your way through this 30 minute cardio at home workout
  without equipment. You’ll perform just one set of each exercise, so it’s
  perfect for those who get bored easily. This routine also includes a chaos
  element, so anytime you hear Coach say “chaos” you are to drop down and
  perform 5 burpees.
