  Yoga For Strength & Healing | Mind Body Yoga To Feel Your Best : Boho
  Beautiful Yoga This yoga class for strength, balance, and peace is going to be
  all about helping you find the inner power within your being. Working through
  different variations of lunges, Warrior Twos, and standing asanas, this yoga
  practice is going to help you re-connect with that inner energy of your soul.
  Through out this yoga flow we will breathe, we will contemplate, we will hold
  and balance. We will re-connect with our inner voice that speaks through our
  heart which will assist us in finding that deeper sensation of true self love
  for our bodies and for our current momentarily existence.


  Being patient and loving will be the key to this yoga practice today. Surrendering and allowing the postures to take you further into this experience of yoga, self-discovery, and inner peace. Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any style of yoga. So bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make.
