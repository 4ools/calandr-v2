  Cardio Kickboxing is a great way to burn calories, relieve stress, and improve
  endurance. This 30 minute cardio kickboxing workout doesnâ€™t require any
  equipment, but you may hold on to a couple of light hand weights or water
  bottles if youâ€™d like to add resistance. Letâ€™s go!


  You can also use a punchbag for this one if you have one at home. Light hand weights or even your hands.


  **be warned the kickboxing ones are a little tougher ðŸ”¥**
