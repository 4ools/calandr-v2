  This Yin Yoga Flow class is going to give you that relaxing deep stretch your
  body has been craving for. Focusing on fusing Vinyasa based flow (Yang) with
  slow and tension releasing postures (Yin), this class is great to do in
  morning as well as anytime during the day as we focus on first warming up the
  body with a flow, and then taking it into a deep release by holding each Yin
  pose for 2 minutes. 




  Remember, breathing is a very important factor in any Yin Yoga class so through out this entire practice make sure you're taking deep breaths in and long slow exhales out. Bring oxygen to your muscles, organs, and mind. Re-energize your nervous system, let go of stress and tension, and become fully present in each moment of each posture as you let go of the past with each exhale you make. 




  ## What is Yin Yoga? 


  Yin Yoga is a style of yoga practice that targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice. 


  Suitable for almost all levels, Yin Yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and muscular (yang) styles of yoga that emphasize internal heat, and the lengthening and contracting of our muscles. Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis, and lower spine.


  Each posture in Yin Yoga is usually held up to 5 min or so. However, if you're very new to this I recommend you start with the 1-2 min holds until you feel more confident in your posture. If you're more of an advanced yogi then feel free to pause the video and hold each pose longer. 


  Yin Yoga has many amazing benefits but below are some of the key benefits you may begin to feel after a regular yin practice:


  * Stillness: calms and balances the mind and body 

  * Stress and anxiety reduction 

  * Increased circulation

  * Improved flexibility

  * Fascial release
