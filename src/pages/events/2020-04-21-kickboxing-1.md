  Get your heart rate up in part 1: Cardio Kickboxing, and then shred your abs
  and arms in part 2. You only need a pair of dumbbells for this one, but you
  may want a mat for comfort. Letâ€™s do this!


  As with the other kickboxing ones:


  - You can do this with your hands

  - You can do this with a punchbag

  - You can do this with weights (light)


  **it is likely harder than the normal HIT workouts**
