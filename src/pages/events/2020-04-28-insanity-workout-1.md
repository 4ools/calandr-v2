  This is another insanity workout they are quite hard as there are very little
  breaks and it is about 40 mins (on average)


  It is a HIT workout but is harder than the normal has fit ones, feel free to join even if just to have a look. Or even give it a bash and take plenty of breaks it can be as hard as you push yourself!
