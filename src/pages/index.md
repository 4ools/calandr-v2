  **Welcome to the lunch workout app.**


  * Click a workout for more information  🖱

  * Check out the video preview for a taste of what's to come 👀

  * Add the workout to your Google Calendar to be reminded 🗓

  * Click the "Go to google meet" button to join the workout! 🏋️‍♀️

  * For the most motivational view install the [Google Meet Grid View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-grid-view/bjkegbgpfgpikgkfidhcihhiflbjgfic) plugin!


  **Please bare in mind:**


  * Mute your 🎤 when we start as there may be many of us and it will be crazy

  * We will start on time as we only have an hour lunch ⌚️

  * You do not have to enable video it is optional


  *I will not add too many workouts in the future as plans may change. However I will try keep it a few weeks in advance so there is a chance to plan. So check back often for workouts*
